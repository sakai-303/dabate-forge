An overview of this project is as follows
- I specify a particular topic and prepare a basic stance along with responses to various anticipated questions.
- An AI representing me engages in discussions with various people about that topic.
- If new perspectives or questions arise during those discussions that I hadn't considered, the system informs me about them.
- I then prepare responses to those new perspectives and questions.
- By repeating these steps, the AI representing me will gradually become capable of engaging in discussions on my behalf.
